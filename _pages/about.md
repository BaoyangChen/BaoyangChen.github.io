# ✌️ About me
I am currently pursuing a master's degree at [the School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University](https://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/). Here is my Curriculum Vitage：[Baoyang's CV](assets/Chen Baoyang-CV.pdf). My research endeavors are presently centered around unraveling the nutritional and immune mechanisms of aquatic animals by employing transcriptomics and multi-omics joint analysis. I possess a solid background in sequencing data processing, transcriptome analysis, and conducting molecular biology experiments. My current research interests encompass a broad spectrum of nutritional metabolism and signaling pathways. Fluent in English and blessed with an easy-going personality, I am adept at collaborating effectively with team members to execute tasks. If my research aligns with your interests, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Comparison effects of *Haematococcus pluvialis* on growth performance, hepatopancreatic transcriptome and resistance to ammonia-nitrogen stress of the Pacific white shrimp (*Litopenaeus vannamei*), ***Animal Nutrition***

  **Baoyang Chen**, Haiqi Pu, Yongkang Chen, et al

- 
The inclusion of 0.02 to 0.08% *H. pluvialis* in the diet significantly enhanced the growth performance of *L. vannamei*. The fitting curve analysis revealed that the optimal supplemental level of *H. pluvialis* for promoting *L. vannamei* growth was determined to be 0.1006%. After the termination of culture, *L. vannamei* was exposed to ammonia nitrogen stress. The supplementation with 0.08 to 0.32% enhanced the resistance of *L. vannamei* towards ammonia nitrogen stress, as evidenced by alterations in hepatopancreas, morphology and structure, cellular apoptosis, and immune gene expression.

Responses in growth performance, antioxidant capacity, hepatopancreas morphology, and non-specific immune function after functional protein peptide replace fishmeal in the Pacific white shrimp (*Litopenaeus vannamei*), ***Aquaculture Nutrition***

**Baoyang Chen**, Jian Zong, Aihua Dong, et al

- 
The growth performance of *L. vannamei* was not negatively affected by the substitution of FM with FPP at levels of 0 to 20%. Additionally, the replacement of FM at levels of 0 to 30% did not result in a significant change in the antioxidant capacity of the hepatopancreas in *L. vannamei*.  The incorporation of low levels of FM replacements has the potential to enhance the immunity and alter the structure of intestinal flora in *L. vannamei*. Ultimately, the optimal replacement level for FPP in shrimp feed is determined to be 20%, as it maximizes benefits while maintaining the growth and health of *L. vannamei*. This study holds great significance for advancing the development and utilization of novel protein sources in aquaculture.
