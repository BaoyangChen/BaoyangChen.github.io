# ✌️ About me
I am currently pursuing a master's degree at [the School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University](https://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/). Here is my CV：[Baoyang's CV](). My research endeavors are presently centered around unraveling the nutritional and immune mechanisms of aquatic animals by employing transcriptomics and multi-omics joint analysis. I possess a solid background in sequencing data processing, transcriptome analysis, and conducting molecular biology experiments. My current research interests encompass a broad spectrum of nutritional metabolism and signaling pathways. Fluent in English and blessed with an easy-going personality, I am adept at collaborating effectively with team members to execute tasks. If my research aligns with your interests, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

[Identification of SNPs and candidate genes associate with growth performance in all-female mandarin fish (*Siniperca chuatsi*) by a genome-wide association study](assets/1-s2.0-S0044848624002394-main.pdf), ***AQUACULTURE***

**Dingrui Liu**, Jin Zhang, Zhenjiang Zou, et al

- 
The first GWAS analysis on growth traits of all-female Mandarin fish (Dinggui I, *Siniperca Chuatsi*) was conducted. A total of 6 significant and 25 suggestive SNPs were detected on multiple chromosomes. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained for these SNPs ranged from 9.66% to 19.47% for growth traits.

[Effects of salinity on growth, physiology, biochemistry and gut microbiota of juvenile grass carp (*Ctenopharyngodon idella*)](assets/1-s2.0-S0166445X23000851-main.pdf), ***AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY***

**Dingrui Liu**, Zhuowei Zhang, Yikun Song, et al

- 
Grass carp exhibited great adaptability to low salinity (2 ppt), with no significant difference in growth and maintained stable physiological and immune status. However, exposed to high salinity (6 ppt) caused deleterious effects on grass carp, including growth inhibition as well as physiological and immune-related changes. The gut microbiota in grass carp changed with salinity.
